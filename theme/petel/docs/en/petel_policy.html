        <h2>Addendum – Instructions for Teachers Using the System</h2>

        <p>Dear Teacher,</p>
        <p>The Department of Science Teaching at the Weizmann Institute of Science expends substantial resources in order to provide you and your student with a rich online teaching environment full of content, teaching and learning tools. We hope that you benefit from them.</p>
        <p>Following are general guidelines that may help you while you use the System.</p>
        <p>The System includes a number of environments, a “classroom environment" – a closed environment for you and your students, environments for teachers only (such as: a collaborative database or a colleague environment) and environments for all of the users (such as: “Ask the Experts").</p>
        <p>The classroom environment is a closed environment intended only for you and your students.</p>
        <p>Please instruct your students:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To make sure they use the System in their designated environments.</li>
            <li>To use the System appropriately, in accordance with the Terms of Use and only for its indented purpose.</li>
            <li>To refrain from uploading identifying information to the System that is not required for registration or for using the System, about themselves or other students, or any other information that is not required for learning purposes.</li>
            <li>Please make sure to receive consent from the student's parent for using the System and providing the aforementioned information. Your usage of the System and/or authorizing your students to use the System, shall constitute as consent and approval that parental consent was indeed given. Without this consent, please refrain from granting the student with said authorization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please make sure that the conversation in the classroom environment remains respectful and concise, and see to removing any content that you believe to be inappropriate as soon as you are aware of it.</p>

        <div class="important-note">
            <h4>Retaining and using your students' System usage data</h4>
            <p>Using the students' scores and performance in the System – subject to the System's privacy policy, the Department or the Institute do not track or use the students' personal scores in the System and they are intended for the teachers and students only (the Institute may use the scores anonymously and without connecting them to a specific student, as detailed below).</p>
            <p>You must determine at your discretion (and subject to the common guidelines at your school and the Ministry of Education guidelines) if and how you will consider the students' scores or the rest if their System usage data, and you must share your decision with them. We recommend that you do this in writing and we will be permitted to require you to do so.</p>
            <p>In any event, the students' System usage data is intended for teaching purposes only and subject to any law. This is your responsibility. This data must not be used or transferred for any other purpose, without receiving lawful consent or in accordance with the provisions of the law, and in any case said use is solely your responsibility.</p>
            <p>Retaining your students' usage data – please note that at the end of your classroom environment's term of validity (as detailed in the registration guidelines addendum) the environment will close down and the usage data will be retained for an additional period of thirty-six months (unless the Institute announces otherwise on shortening or prolonging this period of time). If you will be interested in retaining the data during that period or after it, please take steps to do so, we will publish instructions on how to do this and would be happy to assist you with this in any way we can.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Using the System's Contents</h3>
        <p>The System enables the teachers to locate Content in the collaborative database, transfer it to each teacher's personal environment in which their students are registered, design and adjust the teaching sequence to their classroom and eventually share the successful activities with colleagues from all over the country. The collaborative database contains Content (educational content by the Department and by third parties that allowed it to be used in the System). It is intended for you to use. The Department makes every effort to make the Content useful while allowing you to focus on teaching.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, you are allowed to change, edit or add your own Content in the classroom environment. This means that you are allowed to use all of the Content in the System, change, update and add to it, and every other user will be permitted to do the same with your Content; all of this is to allow all of the users to enjoy the System Content as well as enrich it.</p>

        <h3>Colleague Environment</h3>
        <p>One of the unique characteristics of the PeTeL System is the “Colleague Environment”, which allows the teacher to share Content that they developed as well as insights from activities in their classroom with all other PeTeL teachers.</p>
        <p>The colleague environment has the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Teachers Influence and Follow" feature, which allows teachers to receive an alert each time a teacher that they are following uploads new Content to the collaborative database.</li>
            <li>The “Teacher Colleagues" feature, which allows teachers to ask for access to the teaching sequences of other teachers, and see how they are built as well as use them partially or completely; a teacher-colleague is not exposed to the details and products of students who are from the host teacher's classroom due to privacy considerations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these features were developed in order to support teachers and create a convenient and quick connection between the teachers who are located all over the country.</p>
        <p>The teacher is permitted to log into the colleague environment or log out at any time.</p>

        <h3>Using Third Party Content</h3>
        <p>Should you choose to use third party Content (that is Content that is not System Content or your own original Content) you have the obligation and the responsibility to make sure that you are permitted to do so. Please take into account that most of the Content may be subject to third party copyrights.</p>
        <p>Please remember that simply because certain Content is published online and can technically be copied and distributed easily and without technical restrictions, does not mean that this is allowed.</p>
        <p>In any case, the responsibility for using your Content as well as third party Content lies solely upon you and the Institute shall not be responsible for your usage of said Content.</p>
        <p>You must make sure to be especially careful with Content from others' textbooks and images from the internet.</p>
        <p>Many people mistakenly believe that using images found online without permission (including images uploaded by users to forums, social media networks etc.) is allowed. Many people who own the copyright of the images usually enforce their rights, and using images or other Content without permission may constitute as copyright infringement and entitle the owner to be compensated with general damages.</p>
        <p>Therefore, please refrain from using images found online, unless it is expressly stated that you are permitted to do so.</p>

        <h3>Links to External Content</h3>
        <p>You must completely avoid framing and hidden links to third party Content (in such a way that the user is viewing this Content at the same time as System Content as if they were part of the System) without receiving explicit permission from said third parties. Even when using regular links to third party Content you must make sure to link only legal sites that are related to the learning material in the System, and make sure that the terms of use of said sites do not forbid links. In any case of doubt, we recommend that you contact the owner of the website and ask for their permission to place a link to their website.</p>

        <h3>Distributing Content that You Created in Other Environments in the System Beyond the Classroom</h3>
        <p>If you wish to do so, you may share your created Content with others, by uploading it to the teachers' shared environments. Teaching Content that is uploaded to the collaborative database is published after undergoing a professional, general and initial inspection by the Department. The Department's said inspection is strictly professional and does not constitute as permission to use third party Content, as the Department does not inspect and is not responsible for the proper use of third party Content – the responsibility for not infringing on copyrights lies solely upon you.</p>
